Blackjack is a card game where your goal is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer, without exceeding 21.

### Card Values:
- Cards numbered 2-10 are worth their face value.
- Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) each count as 10 points.
- Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, whichever is more beneficial.
- **Blackjack:** If a hand contains two cards, one of which is an Ace and the other is a 10-point card (totaling exactly 21), this is called a "Blackjack."

### Game Setup:
- The game is played between you (the player) and the dealer.
- An infinite number of decks is used, meaning each card is randomly drawn from a full standard deck each time.

### Gameplay:
1. **Initial Deal:**
   - You are dealt two cards face-up.
   - The dealer receives only one card face-up.

2. **Player's Turn:**
   - You have two possible actions:
     - **Hit:** Draw another card to add to your hand total.
     - **Stand:** End your turn without taking more cards.
   - You can continue to "hit" until you either decide to "stand" or your total exceeds 21 (this is called "busting," resulting in an immediate loss).

3. **Dealer's Turn:**
   - After you stand, the dealer reveals cards one at a time.
   - The dealer must continue to hit until the dealer's total is 17 or higher.
   - The dealer stands on all totals of 17 or greater.

### Winning and Payouts:
- If you exceed 21, you immediately lose, regardless of the dealer's outcome.
- If the dealer exceeds 21 and you have not, you win.
- If neither busts, the higher hand wins.
- If your hand and the dealer's hand have equal totals and neither have a blackjack, the result is a tie ("push"). The wager is returned.
- If your hand and the dealer's hand have equal totals and one has a blackjack, the hand with the blackjack wins. If you have a blackjack, you win 1.5 times your initial wager.
- All other wins pay out at a rate of 1:1.
