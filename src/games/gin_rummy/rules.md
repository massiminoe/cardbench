## The Pack

Gin Rummy is played with a 52 card deck, the wild cards (jokers) are not used.

## Rank of Cards

The order of the cards, from highest to lowest, is: king (K), queen (Q), jack (J), ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, deuce and ace.

As for the value of the cards, the figure cards are worth 10 points and the other cards are worth the value indicated by their pips.

## Object of the Game

Each player uses their hand to form combinations of three or more cards. The first player to successfully end the hand by going Gin or Knocking wins the game.

## The Deal

The deck is spread out on the table and each player takes a card. The player who draws the highest card chooses where to sit and deals out ten cards to each player, one by one, leaving the deck with the remaining cards in the center of the table. The top card of the stock deck is placed face up next to it to start the discard pile.

## The Play

The player who did not deal the cards starts the game, with the option to pick up the upturned card next to the stock deck, meaning that one of their cards must be discarded. If the said card is of no interest, the player passes without discarding. The opponent may, in turn, take that card and discard another, and if they are not interested, they pass without discarding. Then the first player can now take the top card off the stock deck, discarding another. The game continues, with each player in turn being able to take the top card off the stock deck or the discard pile, then discarding a card, but which may not be the same card that they just picked up from the discard pile.

The game consists of players grouping the 10 cards in their hand to make minimum combinations of three cards of the same rank or runs of the same suit. The ace can be combined with the deuce but not with the king (K). A player can fold when their hand contains only unmatched cards worth a total value of no more than 10 points, making a Knock. As soon as a player discards their last card, they show all of their cards, announcing the number of points that are left without combining. It is not compulsory to Knock, a player can prolong the game in order to improve their hand. The best hand is to make Gin, consisting of placing down the ten cards combined.

In either case, when a player folds, exposing all of their cards, the opponent does the same, having the opportunity to get rid of those cards that were left unmatched and being able to combine cards with those exposed by the player who Knocked or announced Gin.

## How to Win

**Gin:** When a player announces Gin (all 10 cards form valid combinations), they immediately win the game.

**Knock:** When a player Knocks (unmatched cards total 10 points or less), the winner is determined by comparing unmatched card values:
- If the knocking player has fewer unmatched points than their opponent, the knocking player wins
- If the opponent has equal or fewer unmatched points than the knocking player, the opponent wins (this is called "undercutting")

The opponent's unmatched cards are counted after they have had the opportunity to lay off cards that can be added to the knocking player's combinations.

**Empty Stock:** If only two cards remain in the stock pile, the game ends immediately. Both players expose their hands. The player with the lower value of unmatched cards wins. If their point totals are equal, the game is a draw.
